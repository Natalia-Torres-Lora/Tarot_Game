# The most common and popular Tarot reading method is the Three-Card Spread. This spread provides a simple and insightful reading, making it perfect for beginners and experienced readers alike.
# Three-Card Spread Layout

# The three cards are typically laid out in a row, with each card representing a specific aspect of the question or situation:
# Past Influences: The first card represents the past influences or events that have led to the current situation.
# Present Situation: The second card represents the current situation or challenge being faced.
# Future Outcome: The third card represents the potential future outcome or guidance for moving forward.
# Example Use Case

# For example, if someone asks about their career prospects, the three-card spread might reveal:
# Past Influences: The 5 of Pentacles, indicating past financial struggles or feelings of insecurity.
# Present Situation: The 8 of Swords, suggesting feelings of being trapped or limited in their current career.
# Future Outcome: The Knight of Wands, indicating a potential new opportunity or career path that involves taking bold action and pursuing one's passions.
# Implementing the Three-Card Spread in Python

# To create a Tarot game in Python, you can start by defining a TarotCard class and a ThreeCardSpread class. Here's a simple example to get you started:
# Python
# import random

# # Define a TarotCard class
# class TarotCard:
#     def __init__(self, name, meaning):
#         self.name = name
#         self.meaning = meaning

# # Define a ThreeCardSpread class
# class ThreeCardSpread:
#     def __init__(self, cards):
#         self.cards = cards

#     def draw_cards(self):
#         return random.sample(self.cards, 3)

# # Create a deck of Tarot cards
# cards = [
#     TarotCard("The Fool", "New beginnings, innocence"),
#     TarotCard("The Magician", "Skill, manifestation, personal power"),
#     # ... add more cards to the deck ...
# ]

# # Create a ThreeCardSpread instance
# spread = ThreeCardSpread(cards)

# # Draw three cards for the spread
# drawn_cards = spread.draw_cards()

# # Print the spread
# print("Three-Card Spread:")
# print(f"Past Influences: {drawn_cards[0].name} - {drawn_cards[0].meaning}")
# print(f"Present Situation: {drawn_cards[1].name} - {drawn_cards[1].meaning}")
# print(f"Future Outcome: {drawn_cards[2].name} - {drawn_cards[2].meaning}")
# This code defines a basic TarotCard class and a ThreeCardSpread class, which can be used to draw three cards for the spread. You can add more cards to the deck and modify the code to suit your needs.
# Remember to keep your code organized, readable, and well-documented. Good luck with your Tarot game project!

# Star Spread: A spread that provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of a question or situation.
# Creating a Tarot Game in Python

# To create a tarot game in Python, you can start by defining a TarotCard class that represents a single tarot card. You can then create a TarotDeck class that represents a deck of tarot cards.
# Next, you can create a TarotReading class that represents a tarot reading. This class can take a TarotDeck object as input and provide methods for performing different types of tarot readings.
# Here's some sample code to get you started:
# Python
# import random

# class TarotCard:
#     def __init__(self, name, meaning):
#         self.name = name
#         self.meaning = meaning

# class TarotDeck:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.cards = []
#         for i in range(78):
#             card = TarotCard(f"Card {i}", f"Meaning {i}")
#             self.cards.append(card)

#     def shuffle(self):
#         random.shuffle(self.cards)

#     def draw_card(self):
#         return self.cards.pop()

# class TarotReading:
#     def __init__(self, deck):
#         self.deck = deck

#     def three_card_spread(self):
#         self.deck.shuffle()
#         past = self.deck.draw_card()
#         present = self.deck.draw_card()
#         future = self.deck.draw_card()
#         return past, present, future

# # Example usage:
# deck = TarotDeck()
# reading = TarotReading(deck)
# past, present, future = reading.three_card_spread()
# print(f"Past: {past.name} - {past.meaning}")
# print(f"Present: {present.name} - {present.meaning}")
# print(f"Future: {future.name} - {future.meaning}")
# This code provides a basic structure for creating a tarot game in Python. You can add more features and functionality as needed.

# Let's go through a step-by-step example of a tarot reading using the Three-Card Spread.
# Step 1: Preparing for the Reading

# The reader (tarot card reader) and the querent (person receiving the reading) sit comfortably in a quiet space.
# The reader shuffles the tarot cards to mix up the order.
# The querent asks a question or specifies an area of focus for the reading (e.g., relationships, career, personal growth).
# Step 2: Drawing the Cards

# The reader draws three cards from the shuffled deck.
# The cards are placed face down on the table in a row.
# Step 3: Revealing the Cards

# The reader flips over the first card, representing Past Influences.
# The reader interprets the meaning of the card in the context of the querent's question or area of focus.
# The reader shares their interpretation with the querent.
# Step 4: Interpreting the Cards

# The reader flips over the second card, representing the Present Situation.
# The reader interprets the meaning of the second card, taking into account the querent's question or area of focus and the influence of the past.
# The reader shares their interpretation with the querent.
# The reader flips over the third card, representing the Future Outcome.
# The reader interprets the meaning of the third card, considering the querent's question or area of focus, the past influences, and the present situation.
# Step 5: Synthesizing the Reading

# The reader synthesizes the interpretations of all three cards, providing a cohesive and meaningful reading.
# The reader offers guidance, insights, and recommendations based on the reading.
# Step 6: Closing the Reading

# The reader and querent discuss any final questions or concerns.
# The reader provides a summary of the key takeaways from the reading.
# The querent is left to reflect on the insights and guidance received during the reading.
# Example Reading:

# Querent's question: "What can I expect in my career over the next few months?"
# Past Influences: 5 of Cups (representing emotional attachment to past experiences)
# Reader's interpretation: "You've been holding onto past experiences or emotions that may be influencing your current career path."
# Present Situation: Knight of Wands (representing action, adventure, and taking risks)
# Reader's interpretation: "You're currently feeling restless and ready to take action in your career. This is a great time to explore new opportunities or take calculated risks."
# Future Outcome: The Star (representing hope, guidance, and positive energy)
# Reader's interpretation: "Over the next few months, you can expect a more positive and hopeful outlook in your career. This is a great time to focus on personal growth and development, as it will lead to new opportunities and success."
# Synthesis: "It's time to let go of past emotional attachments and take action in your career. With a positive and hopeful outlook, you can expect new opportunities and success over the next few months."
