Your Report

* In a word processing application of your choice (such as MS Word or Google Docs), write a report that answers the following questions:

1. What game have you decided for your portfolio project? If you're having a hard time choosing, choose an open-ended game such as a text adventure/choose-your-own-adventure, or one of the other examples given in Week 1.
2. Consider the Python data structures you have learned this week, in relation to your project idea. What are some kinds of data in your project, and what would you guess would be the best way to store that data?
3. Examples:
    * If you have a card game, you might store card values in a list or dictionary.
    * If you have a choose-your-own-adventure game, you might have a list of characters that the player might encounter in the game. 
    * What are the values you might store in a data structure, versus a primitive such as an Integer or Boolean?
4. Based on what you have learned so far, write or rewrite the high-level algorithm for your game. You do not need to use code to write this. You can use pseudocode, or regular English to describe each step of your game. 
5. TIP! If you are looking for more functionality to add to your game, here are some ideas:
        * Keep a high score count, or leaderboard with player names (for the current session since we have not discussed saving data to files; for more advanced Pythonistas, you can try saving the high score/leaderboard to a file). 
        * Set a maximum number of total losses before the game automatically quits. 
        * Add a way for two players at the same computer to play against each other by taking turns at the keyboard.
        * Try to think of other functionality you could add!

# The most common and popular Tarot reading method is the Three-Card Spread. This spread provides a simple and insightful reading, making it perfect for beginners and experienced readers alike.
# Three-Card Spread Layout

# The three cards are typically laid out in a row, with each card representing a specific aspect of the question or situation:
# Past Influences: The first card represents the past influences or events that have led to the current situation.
# Present Situation: The second card represents the current situation or challenge being faced.
# Future Outcome: The third card represents the potential future outcome or guidance for moving forward.
# Example Use Case

# For example, if someone asks about their career prospects, the three-card spread might reveal:
# Past Influences: The 5 of Pentacles, indicating past financial struggles or feelings of insecurity.
# Present Situation: The 8 of Swords, suggesting feelings of being trapped or limited in their current career.
# Future Outcome: The Knight of Wands, indicating a potential new opportunity or career path that involves taking bold action and pursuing one's passions.
# Implementing the Three-Card Spread in Python

# To create a Tarot game in Python, you can start by defining a TarotCard class and a ThreeCardSpread class. Here's a simple example to get you started:
# Python
# import random

# # Define a TarotCard class
# class TarotCard:
#     def __init__(self, name, meaning):
#         self.name = name
#         self.meaning = meaning

# # Define a ThreeCardSpread class
# class ThreeCardSpread:
#     def __init__(self, cards):
#         self.cards = cards

#     def draw_cards(self):
#         return random.sample(self.cards, 3)

# # Create a deck of Tarot cards
# cards = [
#     TarotCard("The Fool", "New beginnings, innocence"),
#     TarotCard("The Magician", "Skill, manifestation, personal power"),
#     # ... add more cards to the deck ...
# ]

# # Create a ThreeCardSpread instance
# spread = ThreeCardSpread(cards)

# # Draw three cards for the spread
# drawn_cards = spread.draw_cards()

# # Print the spread
# print("Three-Card Spread:")
# print(f"Past Influences: {drawn_cards[0].name} - {drawn_cards[0].meaning}")
# print(f"Present Situation: {drawn_cards[1].name} - {drawn_cards[1].meaning}")
# print(f"Future Outcome: {drawn_cards[2].name} - {drawn_cards[2].meaning}")
# This code defines a basic TarotCard class and a ThreeCardSpread class, which can be used to draw three cards for the spread. You can add more cards to the deck and modify the code to suit your needs.
# Remember to keep your code organized, readable, and well-documented. Good luck with your Tarot game project!

# Popular Tarot Reading Methods

# There are several methods of tarot reading, but one of the most common and popular is the Three-Card Spread. This method involves drawing three cards from the deck, each representing a specific aspect of the question or situation being read.
# The Three Cards:

# Past Influences: The first card represents the past influences or events that have led to the current situation.
# Present Situation: The second card represents the current situation or challenge being faced.
# Future Outcome: The third card represents the potential future outcome or guidance for moving forward.
# Other Popular Methods

# Other popular tarot reading methods include:
# Celtic Cross Spread: A more in-depth spread that explores various aspects of a question or situation.
# Relationship Spread: A spread that focuses on the dynamics of a romantic relationship.
# Star Spread: A spread that provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of a question or situation.
# Creating a Tarot Game in Python

# To create a tarot game in Python, you can start by defining a TarotCard class that represents a single tarot card. You can then create a TarotDeck class that represents a deck of tarot cards.
# Next, you can create a TarotReading class that represents a tarot reading. This class can take a TarotDeck object as input and provide methods for performing different types of tarot readings.
# Here's some sample code to get you started:
# Python
# import random

# class TarotCard:
#     def __init__(self, name, meaning):
#         self.name = name
#         self.meaning = meaning

# class TarotDeck:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.cards = []
#         for i in range(78):
#             card = TarotCard(f"Card {i}", f"Meaning {i}")
#             self.cards.append(card)

#     def shuffle(self):
#         random.shuffle(self.cards)

#     def draw_card(self):
#         return self.cards.pop()

# class TarotReading:
#     def __init__(self, deck):
#         self.deck = deck

#     def three_card_spread(self):
#         self.deck.shuffle()
#         past = self.deck.draw_card()
#         present = self.deck.draw_card()
#         future = self.deck.draw_card()
#         return past, present, future

# # Example usage:
# deck = TarotDeck()
# reading = TarotReading(deck)
# past, present, future = reading.three_card_spread()
# print(f"Past: {past.name} - {past.meaning}")
# print(f"Present: {present.name} - {present.meaning}")
# print(f"Future: {future.name} - {future.meaning}")
# This code provides a basic structure for creating a tarot game in Python. You can add more features and functionality as needed.

# Let's go through a step-by-step example of a tarot reading using the Three-Card Spread.
# Step 1: Preparing for the Reading

# The reader (tarot card reader) and the querent (person receiving the reading) sit comfortably in a quiet space.
# The reader shuffles the tarot cards to mix up the order.
# The querent asks a question or specifies an area of focus for the reading (e.g., relationships, career, personal growth).
# Step 2: Drawing the Cards

# The reader draws three cards from the shuffled deck.
# The cards are placed face down on the table in a row.
# Step 3: Revealing the Cards

# The reader flips over the first card, representing Past Influences.
# The reader interprets the meaning of the card in the context of the querent's question or area of focus.
# The reader shares their interpretation with the querent.
# Step 4: Interpreting the Cards

# The reader flips over the second card, representing the Present Situation.
# The reader interprets the meaning of the second card, taking into account the querent's question or area of focus and the influence of the past.
# The reader shares their interpretation with the querent.
# The reader flips over the third card, representing the Future Outcome.
# The reader interprets the meaning of the third card, considering the querent's question or area of focus, the past influences, and the present situation.
# Step 5: Synthesizing the Reading

# The reader synthesizes the interpretations of all three cards, providing a cohesive and meaningful reading.
# The reader offers guidance, insights, and recommendations based on the reading.
# Step 6: Closing the Reading

# The reader and querent discuss any final questions or concerns.
# The reader provides a summary of the key takeaways from the reading.
# The querent is left to reflect on the insights and guidance received during the reading.
# Example Reading:

# Querent's question: "What can I expect in my career over the next few months?"
# Past Influences: 5 of Cups (representing emotional attachment to past experiences)
# Reader's interpretation: "You've been holding onto past experiences or emotions that may be influencing your current career path."
# Present Situation: Knight of Wands (representing action, adventure, and taking risks)
# Reader's interpretation: "You're currently feeling restless and ready to take action in your career. This is a great time to explore new opportunities or take calculated risks."
# Future Outcome: The Star (representing hope, guidance, and positive energy)
# Reader's interpretation: "Over the next few months, you can expect a more positive and hopeful outlook in your career. This is a great time to focus on personal growth and development, as it will lead to new opportunities and success."
# Synthesis: "It's time to let go of past emotional attachments and take action in your career. With a positive and hopeful outlook, you can expect new opportunities and success over the next few months."
